## Decision Making Process

### Consensus Building

The project strives to make decisions through consensus among maintainers and active contributors. For significant changes:

1. **Proposal**: Create a GitHub issue or RFC describing the change

3. **Consensus**: Maintainers work to build consensus among stakeholders
4. **Implementation**: Proceed with implementation once consensus is reached

### Types of Decisions

**Day-to-day Decisions:**
- Bug fixes and minor improvements
- Documentation updates
- Routine maintenance

These can be made by any maintainer or trusted contributor.

**Significant Decisions:**
- New features or major changes
- Breaking changes to APIs
- Changes to project governance
- Addition of new maintainers

These require broader discussion and consensus among maintainers.
