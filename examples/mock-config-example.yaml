# Mock Provider Configuration Example
#
# This file demonstrates the YAML format for configuring mock responses
# used by MockProvider with FileMockRepository. This allows Arena tests,
# SDK examples, and other code to use deterministic responses without
# making actual API calls.
#
# Structure:
# - defaultResponse: Fallback response used when no specific match is found
# - scenarios: Map of scenario IDs to their specific configurations
#   - Each scenario can have:
#     - defaultResponse: Default for this scenario (overrides global)
#     - turns: Map of turn numbers to specific responses

# Global default response (used when no scenario/turn match is found)
defaultResponse: "This is a mock response from the configured provider."

# Scenario-specific configurations
scenarios:
  # Example: Customer support conversation
  customer-support:
    defaultResponse: "Thank you for contacting support. How can I help you today?"
    turns:
      1: "Thank you for reaching out. I understand you're having an issue. Could you provide more details?"
      2: "I've reviewed your account and can see the problem. Let me help you resolve this."
      3: "The issue has been resolved. Is there anything else I can assist you with?"
      4: "You're welcome! Have a great day."

  # Example: Multi-turn technical conversation
  code-review:
    defaultResponse: "I'd be happy to review your code."
    turns:
      1: "This code looks good overall. I have a few suggestions for improvement."
      2: "Here's a refactored version that addresses the performance concerns."
      3: "The error handling could be more robust. Consider adding try-catch blocks."

  # Example: Simple question-answer scenario
  quick-question:
    # No turn-specific responses, just use scenario default
    defaultResponse: "The answer to your question is: 42."

  # Example: Scenario with only turn-specific responses (no scenario default)
  interview:
    turns:
      1: "Tell me about yourself."
      2: "What are your strengths and weaknesses?"
      3: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"
      4: "Do you have any questions for me?"
