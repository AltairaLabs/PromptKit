defaultResponse: "I'm here to help you learn about space and astronomy."

scenarios:
  context-unlimited:
    defaultResponse: "I'm ready to discuss astronomy topics in detail."
    turns:
      1: "The solar system is our cosmic neighborhood, consisting of the Sun and all celestial bodies that orbit it, including eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects."
      2: "The inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are also called terrestrial planets because they have solid, rocky surfaces similar to Earth."
      3: "The outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These are gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) with much larger sizes and different compositions."
      4: "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 142,984 kilometers - more than 11 times wider than Earth."
      5: "You first asked me about the solar system, where I explained it's our cosmic neighborhood with the Sun and all the celestial bodies that orbit it."

  context-limited-oldest:
    defaultResponse: "I'll help you with astronomy questions, though I may not remember everything from earlier in our conversation."
    turns:
      1: "Hi Alice! It's great to meet a 5th grader interested in space. The solar system is fascinating - it includes our Sun and all the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets that orbit around it."
      2: "I'd be happy to tell you about the solar system! There are eight planets that orbit our Sun, and they're divided into inner and outer planets based on their distance and composition."
      3: "The inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars - they're rocky and closer to the Sun. The outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - they're much larger and made mostly of gas and ice."
      4: "Jupiter is amazing! It's the largest planet in our solar system and yes, it does have that famous Great Red Spot - a giant storm that's been raging for hundreds of years."
      5: "Saturn's rings are made of countless chunks of ice and rock, ranging from tiny particles to house-sized boulders. They likely formed from destroyed moons or comets that got too close to Saturn."
      6: "Jupiter has the most moons in our solar system - it has 95 known moons! The four largest ones are called the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto."
      7: "I don't have that information from our current conversation. It seems like our earlier discussion about your introduction might not be available to me right now."

  context-limited-fail:
    defaultResponse: "I'm ready to discuss astronomy topics."
    turns:
      1: "The solar system is our cosmic neighborhood, consisting of the Sun and all the celestial bodies that orbit it - eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and dust."
      2: "There are eight planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each has unique characteristics in terms of size, composition, atmosphere, and distance from the Sun."
      3: "Jupiter and Saturn are truly magnificent! Jupiter is the largest planet with dozens of moons and the Great Red Spot storm. Saturn is famous for its spectacular ring system and also has many fascinating moons like Titan and Enceladus."

  context-with-caching:
    defaultResponse: "I'm an astronomy expert ready to discuss planets and space."
    turns:
      1: "The planets in our solar system are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They orbit the Sun at different distances and have unique characteristics."
      2: "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system. It has extreme temperature variations and a very thin atmosphere."
      3: "Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest in our solar system due to its thick atmosphere creating a runaway greenhouse effect."
      4: "Earth is our home planet - the third from the Sun and the only known planet with life. It has liquid water, a protective atmosphere, and a strong magnetic field."
      5: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, often called the Red Planet due to iron oxide on its surface. It has polar ice caps and evidence of ancient water flow."
      6: "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system - a gas giant with a Great Red Spot storm and over 90 known moons including the four large Galilean moons."
      7: "Saturn is famous for its beautiful ring system and is the second-largest planet. It's a gas giant with many moons, including Titan which has a thick atmosphere."
