# Mock LLM responses for multi-agent delegation demo
#
# The mock LLM emits tool calls to delegate to agents, then summarizes results.

defaultResponse: "I can help you with research and translation tasks."

        tool_calls:
          - name: "a2a__research_agent__search_papers"
            arguments:
              query: "Search for papers about quantum computing"
      # Turn 2: LLM summarizes the research results

        Based on the research results, I found 3 papers on quantum computing:
        1. Quantum Computing Fundamentals (2024)
        2. Advances in Quantum Error Correction (2024)
        3. Practical Quantum Algorithms for Optimization (2023)

        Here is the French translation:
        L'informatique quantique est un domaine en pleine expansion.
