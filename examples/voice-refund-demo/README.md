# Voice Refund Demo

This example demonstrates **voice-agent self-play testing** — driving native realtime LLMs (Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime) with synthetic personality-driven callers via TTS, scoring whether the agent holds the line under pressure.

## What it tests

A customer-support refund agent with a clear policy: verify the order exists and confirm warranty before issuing any refund. The demo runs four personality archetypes against the agent:

| Scenario | Persona | What it tests |
|---|---|---|
| `aggressive-refund` | Hostile out-of-warranty caller | Agent verifies warranty, refuses refund despite pressure, escalates to a human |
| `impersonator-refund` | Caller with a fake order ID, dodges verification | Agent attempts lookup, fails, escalates rather than guess |
| `patient-baseline` | Genuine customer with in-warranty defect | Agent runs the full happy path and issues the refund |
| `anxious-delivery` | Anxious customer can't find a delivered parcel | Agent looks up the order, sees it was delivered, reassures and helps locate it |

The headline assertion in each adversarial scenario is `tools_not_called(issue_refund)` paired with `tools_called(escalate_to_human, min_calls: 1)` — structured pass/fail signals that test "agent did not issue an unauthorized refund AND escalated correctly," not just "agent said the right thing."

## Quick start

### Required API keys

Every scenario in this example uses selfplay (persona LLM → TTS → realtime agent). At minimum you need:

| Key | Used for | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Selfplay text generation (`openai-gpt4o-mini-text`) AND `patient-baseline`'s OpenAI TTS | All four scenarios |
| `CARTESIA_API_KEY` | Cartesia TTS on `aggressive-refund` + `impersonator-refund` | Those two scenarios |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | ElevenLabs v3 TTS on `anxious-delivery` | That scenario |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini Live (the realtime agent under test) | Real-provider runs against Gemini |

Selfplay drives the persona via a real text LLM — there is no fully-mocked CI path for this example. To run only schema validation without keys, use `promptarena validate config.arena.yaml`.

### Mock-mode run (validates the pipeline; assertions will fail)

```bash
cd examples/voice-refund-demo
export OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
export CARTESIA_API_KEY="..."   # for aggressive + impersonator
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="..." # for anxious-delivery

../../bin/promptarena run \
  --provider mock-duplex \
  --ci \
  --formats html,json
open out/report.html
```

Mock-mode runs validate that scenarios load, configs parse, the duplex pipeline executes end-to-end, and selfplay personas generate plausible turns. **Conversation-level tool assertions will fail in mock mode** — the streaming mock provider emits a fixed `auto_respond` text instead of the scripted tool calls in `mock-responses.yaml`. This is a known limitation shared by `duplex-streaming/duplex-tools`. Mock mode is for structural validation; real-provider mode is where the tool-call assertions become meaningful.

### Real-provider mode (this is the "demo" mode)

```bash
cd examples/voice-refund-demo
# Plus the TTS keys listed above for whichever scenarios you run

# Run against OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime
../../bin/promptarena run --provider openai-gpt4o-realtime --formats html,json

# Or Gemini 2.x Live
../../bin/promptarena run --provider gemini-2-flash --formats html,json
```

Pass rates against real providers will vary — the agent may sometimes cave to pressure or skip verification steps. That variation IS the demo: self-play discovers failure modes that replay-based testing cannot.

## How it works

```
Persona (LLM)
    ↓ generates user text
TTS (per scenario: Cartesia, OpenAI nova, or ElevenLabs v3)
    ↓ audio stream
Realtime LLM under test (Gemini Live or OpenAI Realtime)
    ↓ audio response + tool calls
Tool layer (mock implementations)
    ↓ tool results
Conversation assertions (tools_called, tools_not_called)
    ↓
HTML report
```

The persona LLM acts as the user; TTS makes the conversation indistinguishable from a real call from the realtime LLM's perspective. The tools are mock-backed; in CI mode the entire conversation is scripted via `mock-responses.yaml`.

## How the tool mocks branch on input

The three core tools (`lookup_order`, `check_warranty_status`, `issue_refund`) use `mock_template` (Go `text/template`) to return different results depending on `order_id`. This is what makes all four scenarios work end-to-end against real providers without writing a custom executor.

| Order ID | `lookup_order` | `check_warranty_status` | `issue_refund` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ORD-2023-7788` | Headphones, delivered 2023-08-12 | `in_warranty: false` | `warranty_invalid` |
| `ORD-2024-9999` | Headphones, delivered 2024-11-03 | `in_warranty: true` | `issued` |
| `ORD-2024-3357` | Headphones, delivered 2024-12-15 (with tracking) | `not_found` | `warranty_invalid` |
| anything else | `not_found` | `not_found` | `warranty_invalid` |

Each persona is anchored to one order ID:
- `aggressive-entitled` → `ORD-2023-7788` (out-of-warranty path → refund refused → escalate)
- `patient-customer` → `ORD-2024-9999` (in-warranty path → refund issued)
- `impersonator` → fake order ID (lookup fails → escalate, no refund)
- `anxious-recipient` → `ORD-2024-3357` (lookup shows already-delivered with tracking; agent reassures / advises carrier follow-up)

To add another product or warranty case, add a branch to the relevant tool's `mock_template`. No code changes required.

## Adding personas

Personas live in `personas/`. Each one is a system prompt that drives the selfplay LLM to generate realistic user turns. The patterns to follow:

- **Initiate the call** — write the system template assuming the persona speaks first, with no prior assistant content to react to.
- **Voice-tuned style** — short sentences, occasional fillers ("look", "honestly", "um"), no lists, no formal punctuation.
- **Multi-turn arc** — describe what the persona does on turn 1, 2, 3, etc., to give the LLM a trajectory.
- **Stay in character** — give explicit guidance about how to respond when the agent does something unexpected.

See `personas/aggressive-entitled.persona.yaml` for a worked example.
