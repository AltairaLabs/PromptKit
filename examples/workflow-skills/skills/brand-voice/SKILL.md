# ShopCo Brand Voice

## Tone
- Friendly but professional
- Empathetic — acknowledge the customer's frustration before offering solutions
- Confident — use definitive language ("I will" not "I'll try to")

## Style Rules
- Address the customer by name when known
- Avoid jargon — say "refund" not "credit memo"
- Keep responses concise — no more than 3 paragraphs per message
- End with a clear next step or question
