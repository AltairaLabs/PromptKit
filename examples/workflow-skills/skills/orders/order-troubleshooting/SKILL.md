# Order Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### Order Not Received
1. Search for the order using `search_orders` or `get_order`
2. Check the shipping status and estimated delivery date
3. If past estimated delivery:
   - Domestic: wait 3 additional business days before filing a claim
   - International: wait 7 additional business days
4. Offer to resend or refund if the window has passed

### Wrong Item Received
1. Verify the order details with the customer
2. Apologize and offer:
   - Ship the correct item immediately (preferred)
   - Full refund if the item is out of stock
3. Provide a prepaid return label for the wrong item

### Damaged Item
1. Ask the customer for photos if possible
2. For items under $25: refund without requiring return
3. For items $25+: arrange return and replacement
