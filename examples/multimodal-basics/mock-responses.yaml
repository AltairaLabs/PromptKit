# Mock Provider Responses for Multimodal Testing
#
# This file provides deterministic mock responses for testing multimodal
# scenarios without making actual API calls to vision models.

# Global default response
defaultResponse: "I can see the image you've provided. Let me analyze it for you."

  # Image analysis scenario
  image-analysis:
    defaultResponse: "I can see a clear image. Let me provide a detailed analysis."

        I can see this is a well-composed photograph with several interesting elements. 
        The image shows a landscape with mountains in the background, bathed in golden hour lighting. 
        In the foreground, there's a winding path leading through meadow grass. The sky features 
        scattered clouds with warm orange and pink tones from the setting sun. The overall 
        composition follows the rule of thirds, creating a balanced and visually appealing scene. 
        The depth of field suggests this was shot with a wide aperture, keeping the foreground 
        sharp while slightly softening the distant mountains.

        The color palette is predominantly warm, with golden yellows and oranges dominating the scene. 
        The grass in the foreground has a rich amber tone, while the sky transitions from deep blue 
        at the top to warm orange near the horizon. The mountains appear in muted purple-grey tones, 
        providing a cool contrast to the warm foreground. The composition uses leading lines effectively - 
        the path draws the viewer's eye from the bottom right toward the center, while the mountain 
        ridge creates a strong horizontal element across the upper third of the frame. This creates 
        visual depth and guides the viewer through the image.

  # Image comparison scenario
  image-comparison:
    defaultResponse: "I can see both images clearly. Let me compare them for you."
    turns:

        Comparing these two images, I can identify several key differences:
        
        Image 1 (Left):
        - Appears to be taken in natural daylight with softer, diffused lighting
        - Features a more casual composition with organic, natural elements
        - Color palette is cooler with blues and greens predominating
        - The subject appears more relaxed and candid
        - Background is slightly out of focus, creating depth
        
        Image 2 (Right):
        - Uses artificial lighting with harder shadows and more contrast
        - Composition is more formal and structured
        - Warmer color tones with emphasis on golds and browns
        - The subject has a more posed, formal appearance
        - Background is darker, creating more dramatic emphasis on the subject
        
        The main differences lie in lighting technique, color temperature, composition style, 
        and the overall mood conveyed - one casual and natural, the other formal and dramatic.

        Image 2 appears more professional for several reasons:
        
        1. **Lighting Control**: The use of artificial lighting shows deliberate technical control, 
           creating intentional shadows and highlights that add dimension and drama.
        
        2. **Composition**: The more structured, formal composition follows professional photography 
           principles with careful attention to framing and balance.
        
        3. **Color Grading**: The warm, consistent color palette suggests post-processing and color 
           correction, which is standard in professional work.
        
        4. **Background Management**: The controlled, darker background eliminates distractions and 
           focuses attention on the subject - a hallmark of professional portraiture.
        
        5. **Overall Polish**: The image has a refined, finished quality that suggests it went 
           through a professional workflow from capture to final edit.
        
        While Image 1 has its own appeal with natural authenticity, Image 2 demonstrates technical 
        proficiency and intentional creative choices typical of professional photography work.
