  system_prompt: |
    Generate a natural user message that continues this conversation.
    The user is curious and wants to learn more about the topic being discussed.
    Keep the message brief (1-2 sentences).
    The message should ask a relevant follow-up question based on what was previously said.
  
  guidelines:
    - Generate only the user's message text, nothing else
    - Keep it conversational and natural
    - One question at a time
    - Can include brief acknowledgment like "Interesting!" before the question
  
  examples:
    - "Interesting! Can you tell me more about how that works?"
    - "What are some specific examples of that?"
    - "That makes sense. How does that compare to other approaches?"
