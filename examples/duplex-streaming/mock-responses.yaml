  # Basic duplex scenario responses
  duplex-basic:
    defaultResponse: "I'm Nova, your voice assistant. I'm happy to help!"
    turns:
      1: "Hello! Yes, I can hear you perfectly. I'm Nova, your voice assistant from TechCorp. How can I help you today?"
      2: "My name is Nova, and I'm here to help you with a variety of tasks. I can answer questions, provide information, help with troubleshooting, or just have a friendly conversation. What would you like to know more about?"
      3: "Here's a fun fact for you: Honey never spoils! Archaeologists have found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs that was still perfectly edible. Pretty amazing, right?"

  # Self-play scenario responses (for the selfplay USER messages)
  # Note: These are what the simulated curious customer says, NOT the assistant
  duplex-selfplay:
    defaultResponse: "That's interesting! Can you tell me more?"
    turns:
      # Turn 1 is after assistant's first greeting, so selfplay asks a question
      1: "Oh that sounds helpful! What kind of services do you offer exactly?"
      # Turn 2 is after assistant describes services
      2: "Interesting! And um, is there like a demo I could try first?"
      # Turn 3 is after assistant answers about demo
      3: "That sounds great. What about pricing options?"
      # Turn 4 is closing
      4: "Thanks, that's really helpful!"

  # Interactive scenario responses
  duplex-interactive:
    defaultResponse: "I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble. Let me help you resolve this."
    turns:
      1: "I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your account. Let me help you troubleshoot this. Can you tell me what error message you're seeing exactly?"
      2: "I understand. That error typically occurs when there's a session issue. Since clearing the cache didn't help, let's try a few other things. First, could you try logging out completely and then logging back in?"
      3: "Good to know. Sometimes the issue is browser-specific. Could you try accessing your account from a different browser or in an incognito window? That often helps isolate the problem."
      4: "If that doesn't work, we might need to reset your session on our end. I can do that for you right now if you'd like. It only takes a moment and won't affect any of your data."
      5: "Let me reset your session now. Please wait just a moment... Done! Try logging in again now."
      6: "Wonderful, I'm so glad that worked! Your session has been refreshed and you should be all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

# Self-play mock responses (for generating user messages)

  curious-customer:
    defaultResponse: "That's interesting! Can you tell me more?"
    turns:
      1: "Oh that sounds great! What kind of pricing options do you have?"
      2: "Interesting. And is there like a demo I could try out first?"

  technical-user:
    defaultResponse: "Okay, let me try that."
    turns:
      1: "What error code should I be looking for in the console?"
      2: "Alright, I'll try that. Do I need to clear any local storage too?"
      3: "Okay done. Still seeing the error. What's next?"
      4: "Let me try incognito mode... actually that seems to be working!"
      5: "Perfect, that fixed it. Thanks for walking me through this."
