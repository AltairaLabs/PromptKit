[skip-pre-commit] refactor(arena): deduplicate tool-call result matching in assertions (#488)

Extract the shared ID-first / name-fallback matching algorithm from
context_builder.go and turn_tool_trace.go into a single matchResult
function in tool_result_matcher.go. Both call sites now delegate to
this shared function via the toolCallEntry interface, eliminating the
duplicated logic while preserving identical matching semantics.
